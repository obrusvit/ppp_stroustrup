There is no postal code on this line.
Even there is none.
7777. There is something that looks like one but isn't.
Maybe I will go to Prague, 120 00.
Previously I lived in something like 773 45.
Coool, let's see if this matches 773    54.
What about if we have two postals: 778 12, and then 34542.
77345
