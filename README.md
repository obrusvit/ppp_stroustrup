# PPP
Example code, experiments and exercises from Programming - Principles and Practise using C++. I didn't finish everything, only stuff that I found interesting or worthy of practising for me. 
There is quite complete (I wish, lol) implementation of std::vector-like Vector and nice TEA (Tiny encryption algorithm).
